## Core content
### Role map
| Role | HIPAA / ops duty | Evidence |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Security official | Policies, SRA, contingency [3] | Appointment memo |
| Privacy lead | Privacy Rule training outline [2] | Attendance log |
| PIC | Class C downtime/backup duties [6]; practice oversight | SOP sign-off |
| Vendor CSM | MFA, audit export, uptime | Written commitments |

### Synthetic acceptance tests
1. Create fictional patient; e-Rx path; verify hazard checklist informed by [7][8].  
2. Disable network → auxiliary downtime procedure captures data for later entry [6].  
3. Export audit log for test user actions.  
4. Confirm BA contact path for security incident [4].  
5. Print/retrieve test CS e-Rx record at registered location [5].  
6. Backup restore smoke test; document RPO observed (editorial metric).

### Go-live packet
- [ ] Scorecard passed  
- [ ] BAA executed  
- [ ] Access provisioning least-privilege  
- [ ] Downtime SOP drilled  
- [ ] Hypercare roster  

### Evidence discipline
Prefer OCR primary summaries for Privacy, Security, and Breach duties [1][2][3][4]. Texas Class C data-processing shalls are setting-specific — confirm class before applying [6]. HIT safety papers support training and SRA scoping, not vendor awards [7][8][9]. Monitor OCR notices for Security Rule proposed modifications; this pack cites the current summary only.

## Setting branches
Skip any branch that does not apply. Synthetic examples only — no real patient or facility identifiers.

### Community (independent / retail)
Retail PMS plus e-prescribing networks are the usual ePHI spine. Score vendors on signed BAA, unique user ID/MFA, and audit-log export before price [1][3]. Peer-reviewed sociotechnical work shows e-prescribing can introduce new hazards across technology, people, and organization [7][8] — use that to design verification checklists, not to ban e-Rx.

### ASC / consulting pharmacy
ADC–EHR interfaces and Class C data-processing rules (monthly backup, downtime auxiliary procedure, 10-day significant data-loss report) apply alongside HIPAA Security contingency planning [3][6]. Name who is security official for the pharmacy versus the facility IT lead.

### Clinic-embedded
Shared clinic EHRs force an early CE/BA determination: is the pharmacy workforce of the clinic CE, a separate CE, or a BA? Do not share PHI with a new app vendor without a written BA arrangement when required [1].

### Specialty / infusion / compounding
Specialty hubs often add remote access, patient support portals, and courier integrations. Each processor that creates/receives/maintains/transmits PHI needs BA review [1]. Retain Security Rule documentation six years [3].

### Telepharmacy / delivery
Remote verification stacks need unique authentication and encryption addressed in the security risk analysis (editorial practice tip + Security Rule risk analysis duty) [3]. Electronic CS prescription records must remain readily retrievable/printable at the registered location under Part 1304 orientations [5].


## Local adaptation — Texas verification checklist

Complete with PIC (and counsel for L3 rows) against **live** primary pages on the day you rely on them. Forms and PDF revisions change.

- [ ] Confirm Class C backup: information in data processing system backed up at least **monthly** [6].
- [ ] PIC reports **significant loss of information** to the Board within **10 days** of discovery [6].
- [ ] Auxiliary procedure for data-processing **downtime** that retains data for later on-line entry [6].
- [ ] Map HIPAA Security contingency plan duties (backup/restore/emergency-mode) to pharmacy downtime SOP [3].
- [ ] Confirm electronic CS Rx records readily retrievable/printable at registered location per Part 1304 / 1311 stack [5].
- [ ] Name security official responsible for Security Rule policies [3].
- [ ] Retention: Security Rule documentation ≥ **6 years** after later of creation or last effective date [3].

## Unresolved / held
- OCR Security Rule NPRM (proposed modifications) noted on OCR pages — monitor for final rule; this pack cites the current summary only.
- Product-specific PMS/e-Rx endorsements: **out of scope**.
- **HELD (editorial):** MFA/RTO/RPO scoring tips; telepharmacy encryption stack tips — practice suggestions, not shalls.
- Exact multi-year Texas pharmacy record retention matrix beyond Class C citations: verify Class A / other classes separately before publishing a single statewide table.
